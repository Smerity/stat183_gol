Kaggle Game of Life competition

Coding hints: speeding up R with Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilers 
-------------------------------------------------------------

As you might have noticed, R is painfully slow when performing computationally complex tasks, being at least 400 times slower than C and even 20 times slower than Python. If you're interested in just how extreme the difference between languages can be, check out this [Fibonacci benchmark](https://gist.github.com/Smerity/8902470). We'll be arguing for the usage of other languages for these Kaggle tasks as in many cases, whilst R may be good for experimentation, R itself is not the correct tool for the job.

JIT compilation does two things. First, it works out which parts of your code are most commonly called (such as the *predict board* function) and then tries to optimize the generated machine code in that section. This can lead to a signficant boost in performance.

For the Fibonacci example above, R took 2 minutes and 45 seconds to complete. Just by adding the two lines below, R completed the same task in only 1 minute 11 seconds, or a third of the original time.

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(compiler)
enableJIT(3)
```

Our strategy for reversing the GoL
----------------------------------

During our experiments, the simplest and easiest win we found was when to use the two benchmark cases: **same = end** and **all off**.
We first realized that for cases where delta was equal to 1, the heuristic of setting the start boards equal the end boards did a substantially better job than the all off base case. For these isolated cases our error was around 0.116957.

From here we tried applying the same heuristic to cases where delta was greater than 1 but decided which benchmark to use depending on the number of pixels alive at the end board. This doesn't appear to be useful as the wins are either minimal (i.e. the thresholds would only work in cases of few pixels being on) or impacted by noise.

Instead of simply using the **all off** method in the final submission, we used the box method provided earlier to get a small performance gain.

For graphs showing the difference in performance between the **same = end** and **all off**, refer below.

Submitting a solution
---------------------

To submit a solution, simply run the *submission_code.R* script, ensuring that there is a directory calld *data* that contains *train.csv* and *test.csv*. A file shall be produced called *to_submit.csv* which has our final submission. For simplicity, however, we have included our submission file as a zip in the folder.
